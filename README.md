# Pantry Pulse: AI-Powered Pantry Management System

This repository contains the files for **Pantry Pulse**, a full-stack web application designed to streamline inventory and supply chain operations for offices. This project showcases the power of **Generative AI** and **no-code** development, as the entire application was built by a Prompt Engineer without writing a single line of code.

## Project Description

This application was developed using **vibe coding** and **AI coder** tools, highlighting a modern approach to rapid application development. It demonstrates that with the right **prompt engineering** skills, a robust and functional web application can be created efficiently, bypassing traditional coding methods.

## Features

The application provides two distinct user roles, Admin and Vendor, to ensure a transparent and efficient process, starting with a login/signup screen for user authentication.

### Admin Dashboard

* **Key Metrics:** View a summary of total items, low stock items, and monthly consumption.
